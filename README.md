# Snake Game
This project is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game, built using the Javascript programming language.
## Features

- The game supports multiplayer gameplay, where multiple players can connect and interact in the same Snake Movement: Implement the classic snake movement mechanic, where the player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys or other input methods.

- Food Generation: Randomly generate food items on the game board for the snake to consume. When the snake eats food, it should grow longer.

- Collision Detection: Check for collisions between the snake's head and its body, the walls of the game board, and the food items. The game should end if the snake collides with itself or the walls.

- Scoring System: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed. You can display the current score on the screen.

- High Scores: Create a high score leaderboard to record the top scores achieved by different players. This adds a competitive aspect to the game.
